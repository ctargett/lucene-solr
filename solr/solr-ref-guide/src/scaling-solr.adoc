Solr supports large implementations.

The section <<clusters.adoc#,Solr Clusters>> describes the two main approaches available for scaling.

Both approaches share the ability to distribute parts of an index across multiple servers, a process called _sharding_.
This allows for an index that is larger than any one server can host and maintain reasonable performance.

A second process called _replication_ is also shared by both approaches.
This allows for copying the index (in whole or as shards) across multiple servers, and provides query volume distribution.
